      "Fast and agile with a focus on rapid strikes and hit-and-run tactics.",
    longDesc:
      "The Scout is the fastest class in the game, excelling at quick skirmishes and hit-and-run attacks. His nimble frame and superior mobility make him ideal for capturing objectives and harassing enemies from unexpected angles. Scout thrives in close-quarters combat with his Scattergun and melee weapons, but must rely on speed and positioning to avoid taking heavy damage.",
    bioDesc: "The youngest of eight boys from the south side of Boston, the Scout learned early how to problem solve with his fists. With seven older brothers on his side, fights tended to end before the runt of the litter could maneuver into punching distance, so the Scout trained himself to run. He ran everywhere, all the time, until he could beat his pack of mad dog siblings to the fray.",

      "Balanced offense class with rocket-based area damage and mobility.",
    longDesc:
      "The Soldier is a versatile offensive powerhouse, equipped with a Rocket Launcher for dealing significant splash damage. His mobility comes from Rocket Jumping, which allows a trained player to reach unexpected positions and control the fight. The Soldier excels at mid-range combat and can deal consistent damage to both groups of enemies and single targets with good aim.",
    bioDesc: "Though he wanted desperately to fight in World War 2, the Soldier was rejected from every branch of the U.S. military. Undaunted, he bought his own ticket to Europe. After arriving and finally locating Poland, the Soldier taught himself how to load and fire a variety of weapons before embarking on a Nazi killing spree for which he was awarded several medals that he designed and made himself. His rampage ended immediately upon hearing about the end of the war in 1949.",

    longDesc:
      "The Pyro is a mysterious fire-wielding class that dominates in close-quarters combat with their flamethrower. Their airblast ability can deflect incoming projectiles and push enemies away, making them excellent at both offense and defense. Pyro excels at ambushes and can turn the tide of battle by reflecting rockets and other projectiles back at enemies.",
    bioDesc: "Only two things are known for sure about the mysterious Pyro: he sets things on fire and he doesn't speak. In fact, only the part about setting things on fire is undisputed. Some believe his occasional rasping wheeze may be an attempt to communicate through a mouth obstructed by a filter and attached to lungs ravaged by constant exposure to his asbestos-lined suit. Either way, he's a fearsome, inscrutable, on-fire Frankenstein of a man - if he even is a man.",

      "The Demoman is an explosive expert who controls large areas with his Grenade Launcher and Stickybomb Launcher. His ability to place and detonate stickybombs at will gives him unparalleled control and versatility. Demoman can handle both direct combat and laid traps, making him effective in defensive positions and during aggressive pushes. His one-eyed depth perception is a small price to pay for his explosive prowess.",
    bioDesc: "A fierce temper, a fascination with all things explosive, and a terrible plan to kill the Loch Ness Monster cost the six year old Demoman his original set of adoptive parents. Later, back at the Crypt Grammar School for Orphans near Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands, the boy's bomb-making skills improved dramatically. His disposition and total number of intact eyeballs, however, did not.",

While his movement speed is reduced, his firepower is unmatched in sustained combat. The Heavy is excellent for holding positions, protecting teammates, and suppressing enemy advances. His presence alone can dictate the flow of a battle.",
    bioDesc: "Like a hibernating bear, the Heavy appears to be a gentle giant. Also like a bear, confusing his deliberate, sleepy demeanor with gentleness will get you ripped limb from limb. Though he speaks simply and moves with an economy of energy that's often confused with napping, the Heavy isn't dumb, he's not your big friend, and he generally wishes you'd just shut up before he has to make you shut up.",

These structures provide defense, healing, and map control. The Engineer excels at holding positions and enabling his team to advance. His ability to upgrade structures makes them increasingly formidable, turning him into a force multiplier for the entire team.",
    bioDesc: "This amiable, soft-spoken good ol' boy from tiny Bee Cave, Texas loves barbeque, guns, and higher education. Natural curiosity, ten years as a roughneck in the west Texas oilfields, and eleven hard science PhDs have trained him to design, build and repair a variety of deadly contraptions.",

His signature ability, Übercharge, grants temporary invulnerability to himself and his patient, allowing aggressive plays and turning team fights. The Medic's ability to heal and support multiple fronts on the battlefield makes him indispensable to any team looking to maintain control and sustain momentum. Building and managing Übercharge is critical to controlling the pace of battle.",
    bioDesc: "What he lacks in compassion for the sick, respect for human dignity, and any sort of verifiable formal training in medicine, the Medic more than makes up for with a bottomless supply of giant needles and a trembling enthusiasm for plunging them into exposed flesh. Raised in Stuttgart, Germany during an era when the Hippocratic oath had been downgraded to an optional Hippocratic suggestion, the Medic considers healing a generally unintended side effect of satisfying his own morbid curiosity.",

Sniper excels at taking out key targets and denying enemy advances through superior positioning and aim. His utility from items like the Jarate makes him a versatile support player who can adapt to various situations.",
    bioDesc: "In his former life as a tracker of dangerous game in the unforgiving Australian outback, the Sniper would spend months by himself. Prolonged isolation taught him a valuable lesson: You don't have to rely on other people if you never miss.",

His information gathering and target elimination capabilities make him a high-skill, high-reward class.",
